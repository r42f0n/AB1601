Academic Year 2024/2025 Semester 1Course Code AB1601 Course Title Organizational Behavior and Design Pre-requisites Nil No of AUs 3 AUs Contact Hours 39 
A) Course Aims 
Business is in the midst of a revolutionary transformation. Emerging technologies that combine AI, machine learning, cutting-edge visualization techniques, and social robots are fast revolutionizing the business workplace globally. Building a motivated workforce is a critical responsibility of managers. To do so, managers must know why people behave in organizations the way they do.
Research in cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence and neuroscience has generated significant insights that can enrich our knowledge of people. This course focuses on processes and methods that can improve the attitudes and behaviors of organizational members. You will learn to know more about yourself and others. You will also learn how to influence and predict your own behaviours as well as those of others. Within the context of a world of social media, AI, and machine learning, you will learn various organizational behaviour theories and concepts, and then apply them appropriately to real-life situations to make sense of human behaviours and human-robot interactions at work. This course adopts a flipped classroom approach, which will give you many opportunities to share your knowledge with others and learn with them collaboratively.
B) Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)/Objectives 
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
1. Apply critical thinking to analyze diverse arguments and reconcile divergent viewpoints.

代做程序编程语言al exercises and assignments are designed to demonstrate the relevance of various theoretical frameworks and concept in analyzing and solving management problems and issues.
Approach How does this approach support you in achieving the learning outcomes? 
Critical Thinking                                               To do this assignment, you apply the critical thinking processes to critically evaluate the quality of a published article with regards to its truthfulness and the validity of its arguments.
This assignment shows you how to examine any piece of written work critically.
Design Thinking                                                In this assignment, you apply the three main processes of design thinking, i.e., inspiration, ideation, and implementation, to explore the complexity of a problem and then generate a workable set of solutions.
This assignment helps you develop non-linear, iterative thinking processes that help to identify and break down complex problems, challenge embedded assumptions, integrate multiple perspectives, and create workable innovative solutions through prototyping and testing.
This assignment enables you to learn how to facilitate change in organizational behavior. through the design of workplaces and work procedures.
sizeUP                                                                            At the start of each seminar, your instructor will conduct a quiz or give you a list of short-answer questions for you to answer individually.
By doing this start-of-class activity, you get to size up the effectiveness of your pre-class preparation and your readiness to participate in the various seminar activities
powerUP                                                                        In each seminar, you participate in various powerUP experiential exercises. These exercises illustrate the relevance of OB theoretical frameworks and concepts in the analyzing of organizational situations.
By taking an active role in various experiential exercises, you will experience, hands-on, how various OB theoretical frameworks and concepts can come alive in real-life situations.
teamUP                                                                            You will work in a team of 4 to 6 members to complete a team project in analyzing a real-world management issue.
